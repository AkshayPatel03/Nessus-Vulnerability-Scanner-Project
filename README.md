Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Nessus, a leading vulnerability scanner, to perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments, risk analysis, remediation planning, and report generation. The setup utilizes VirtualBox as the virtualization platform and includes Metasploitable 2 as a target for testing vulnerabilities.

Tools and Software Used
VirtualBox: Virtualization software for creating and managing VMs.
Nessus: Industry-standard vulnerability scanner by Tenable.
Metasploitable 2: Purposefully vulnerable VM for security testing.
Kali Linux (Optional): Linux distribution with additional security tools.
Report Generation Tool: Microsoft Word or Google Docs for creating detailed reports.
Detailed Project Outline
1. Setting Up the Virtual Environment
1.1. Install VirtualBox
Step 1: Download VirtualBox from the official website.
Step 2: Install VirtualBox on your host machine following the installation wizard.
1.2. Install Metasploitable 2
Step 1: Download Metasploitable 2 from the official source.
Step 2: Import the Metasploitable 2 VM into VirtualBox.
Step 3: Configure network settings (e.g., NAT, Bridged Adapter) for the Metasploitable 2 VM.
Step 4: Start the Metasploitable 2 VM and ensure it's running properly.
2. Setting Up Nessus
2.1. Install Nessus
Step 1: Download Nessus from the Tenable website.
Step 2: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows/Linux).
Step 3: Start the Nessus server and access the Nessus web interface.
2.2. Configure Nessus
Step 1: Log in to the Nessus web interface using your credentials.
Step 2: Set up a new scan policy specifying the target as the IP address of the Metasploitable 2 VM.
Step 3: Configure scan options such as scan type (e.g., Basic Network Scan, Web Application Tests), port scanning preferences, and scheduling if needed.
3. Performing the Vulnerability Scan
3.1. Initiating the Scan
Step 1: Start the Nessus scan on the configured target (Metasploitable 2 VM).
Step 2: Monitor the progress of the scan through the Nessus web interface.
Step 3: Wait for the scan to complete, ensuring all selected targets and options are thoroughly assessed.
3.2. Reviewing Scan Results
Step 1: Access and review the scan results provided by Nessus.
Step 2: Identify and classify vulnerabilities based on severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
Step 3: Analyze vulnerability details including descriptions, recommendations, and potential impact on systems.
4. Risk Assessment and Remediation
4.1. Risk Assessment
Step 1: Evaluate the impact of identified vulnerabilities on the overall system security.
Step 2: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact on business operations.
4.2. Vulnerability Remediation
Step 1: Document detailed remediation steps for each identified vulnerability.
Step 2: Apply fixes, patches, or configuration changes to mitigate vulnerabilities on the Metasploitable 2 VM.
Step 3: Verify the effectiveness of remediation measures through re-scans or manual verification.
5. Generating the Project Report
5.1. Creating the Report
Step 1: Compile all findings into a structured report format.
Step 2: Include an executive summary summarizing the project scope, objectives, and key findings.
Step 3: Detail vulnerability scan results, risk assessment findings, and remediation recommendations.
5.2. Adding Screenshots
Step 1: Capture screenshots throughout the project phases (setup, scanning, results, remediation).
Step 2: Integrate screenshots into the report to illustrate key points and enhance understanding.
Project Screenshots
Include screenshots illustrating the following key steps and components of the project:

VirtualBox Setup: Screenshots showing VirtualBox with the Metasploitable 2 VM running.

Nessus Dashboard: Screenshots demonstrating the configuration of Nessus scans, ongoing scans, and completed scans.

Scan Results: Screenshots showcasing sample Nessus scan results, highlighting identified vulnerabilities with severity levels.

Risk Assessment and Remediation: Screenshots of documents or spreadsheets outlining risk assessment findings, prioritized vulnerabilities, and detailed remediation plans.

Final Report for Client
The final project report is available in the Report directory of this repository. It includes:

Executive Summary: A concise overview of the project objectives, methodology, and key findings.
Vulnerability Findings: Detailed analysis of vulnerabilities discovered during the Nessus scan.
Risk Assessment: Evaluation of identified risks based on severity and potential impact.
Remediation Steps: Comprehensive guide to mitigating vulnerabilities, including step-by-step instructions.
Screenshots: Visual aids to illustrate key project phases, such as scan results and remediation evidence.
