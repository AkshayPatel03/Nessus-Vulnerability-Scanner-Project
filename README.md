# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the comprehensive use of Nessus, a powerful vulnerability scanner, to perform vulnerability assessments, risk analysis, remediation planning, and report generation. The setup utilizes VirtualBox as the virtualization platform and includes Metasploitable 2 and Windows 10 as a target for testing vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Software Used

- **VirtualBox**: Virtualization software for creating and managing VMs.
- **Nessus**: Leading vulnerability scanner by Tenable.
- **Metasploitable 2**: A purposely vulnerable VM for security testing.
- **Windows 10** (Optional): Windows 10 Virtual machine with/without old vulneraable software installed.
- **Kali Linux** (Optional): Linux distribution with additional security tools.
- **Report Generation Tool**: Microsoft Word or Google Docs for creating detailed reports.

## Setup Instructions

### Note: Go to one of my [Home Lab for Cybersecurity Project](https://github.com/AkshayPatel03/home-lab-for-cybersecurity) to learn how to develop secure virtaul environment to pratice.

### 1. Install VirtualBox

Download and install VirtualBox from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

### 2. Install Metasploitable 2

Download Metasploitable 2 from the [official source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/).

### 2. Install Windows 10

Download Windows 10 from the [official source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO).

### 3. Install Nessus

Download Nessus from the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).

- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Start Nessus and create an account.

### 4. Configure Nessus

- Launch Nessus and log in using your credentials.
- Set up a new scan targeting the IP address of the Metasploitable 2 VM.

### 5. Perform the Scan

- Run the Nessus scan on the Metasploitable 2 VM.
- Monitor the progress of the scan and wait for it to complete.
- Save and export the scan results for further analysis.

### 6. Risk Assessment

- Review the Nessus scan results thoroughly.
- Categorize vulnerabilities into critical, high, medium, and low severity levels.
- Assess the potential impact of each vulnerability on the system.

### 7. Vulnerability Remediation

- Document step-by-step instructions to remediate identified vulnerabilities.
- Prioritize remediation based on severity and potential impact.
- Apply fixes and patches to the Metasploitable 2 VM to mitigate risks.

### 8. Generate Report

- Compile a detailed report summarizing the findings of the Nessus scan.
- Include an executive summary, vulnerability assessment details, risk analysis, and recommended remediation steps.
- Enhance the report with screenshots of Nessus scans, vulnerability assessment charts, and remediation actions.

## Project Screenshots

Ensure to include screenshots illustrating the following key steps and components of the project:

1. **VirtualBox Setup**: Screenshots of VirtualBox with VMs running, including Metasploitable 2.
2. **Nessus Dashboard**: Screenshots demonstrating the configuration of Nessus scans and monitoring progress.
3. **Scan Results**: Screenshots showcasing sample scan results from Nessus, highlighting identified vulnerabilities.
4. **Risk Assessment and Remediation**: Screenshots of documents or spreadsheets outlining risk assessment findings, prioritized vulnerabilities, and remediation plans.

## Report for Client

The final project report is accessible in the `Report` directory of this repository. The report includes:

- **Executive Summary**: Overview of the project objectives, methodology, and key findings.
- **Vulnerability Findings**: Detailed analysis of vulnerabilities discovered during the Nessus scan.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of identified risks based on severity and potential impact.
- **Remediation Steps**: Comprehensive guide to mitigating vulnerabilities, including step-by-step instructions.
- **Screenshots**: Visual aids to enhance understanding, such as scan results and remediation evidence.
